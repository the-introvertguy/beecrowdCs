# beecrowdCs
Here is all the codes I solved in BEECROWD for study in C language.
## Self Introduction
Hello there , I hope you are having a wonderful day
Myself Mohd. Mehedi Hasan Jihad</br>
A student from [Daffodil Int. University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/)
</br> I am actually not quite familiar to this coding world but i still try to crack open an algorithm to solve problems. Sometime I took help from ChatGPT, so shouldn't GPT half of my tuition fees?!</br>
Jokes aside, it is a self coding workspace for me. But I try to keep track of everything. So I'll try to upload all the codes From Today and onwards.</br>
</br>
</br>

## Repo listing
if you go [here](FIles), you can find all the necessary files of C Language and C language only.</br>
But I'll make another directory for .cpp files; hopefully in the upcoming 2 months


##List of problems
Here i'll try to list all problem and update 'em frequently
